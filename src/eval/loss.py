    Compute the cross entropy loss given outputs and labels.
    Args:
        outputs: (Variable) dimension batch_size x 6 - output of the model
        labels: (Variable) dimension batch_size, where each element is a value in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    Returns:
        loss (Variable): cross entropy loss for all images in the batch
    Note: you may use a standard loss function from http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#loss-functions. This example
          demonstrates how you can easily define a custom loss function.

# Personal Pytorch Template

This repo aims nothing really big. It is to provide a starter skeleton code for pytorch project that I found to be somewhat in a variety of other projects
based on pytorch, be it about training a model, providing an inference interface for a family of models, etc

The folder structure:

Model folder
This folder is for defining the interface of family of models defined in the project.

Utils folder:
To defined various utilities including defining optimizers, logging, etc.

Data folder:
Data interface to load various data
